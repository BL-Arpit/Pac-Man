# Pacman

Vintage Pacman Game developed with the help of Flutter. 


## Project Structure: 
The rough breakdown of the game will consist of game logic and I/O. 
The game logic will consist of collision detection, scoring, and
enemy AI. The I/O will include mostly interaction with the touch
and if time forbids, maybe a keyboard/joystick to make it accessible on PCs too.
Current state of the game is mainly implementation of the game logic and sound effects.
Further during the timeline, the plan is to improve the frame rate and add a 
ranking system based on highscore into the game. 

## Dependencies
1. audioplayers: ^0.17.0
